# Sphere
![[Pasted image 20240904222302.png]]

â­• A sphere is a **perfectly symmetrical** 3D geometric shape, *where all points on the surface are equidistant from a single point known as the center*.

## General Equation of Sphere:
$$\color{orange}(xâˆ’x_0)^2+(yâˆ’y_0)^2+(zâˆ’z_0)^2=r^2\tag{1}$$
___
$$x^2+y^2+z^2+2gx+2fy+2hz+c=0\tag{2}$$
Both equations are the general form of a sphere.
Where,
ðŸŸ¡ Center: $\color{orange}C(-g,-h,-f)$ or $C(x_0, y_0, z_0)$
ðŸŸ£ Radius: $r=\sqrt{g^2+f^2+h^2-c}$
___
ðŸ”µ Cutting a sphere by a 3D plane we get a perfect circle Which is in image blue one.

ðŸ”´ When plane passes through a Sphere we get a circle:
- Let Circle: $S$ 
- Let Plane: $P$
	- Then the Sphere is:
		- $$\color{red}S+kP=0\tag{1}$$

ðŸŸ¢ <span style="background:#fff88f">The radius of the circle (S) will be equal to the perpendicular length of the center (C) to the tangent plane(P).</span>
