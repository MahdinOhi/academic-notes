### Algorithm to Find the Shortest Distance Between Two Lines
#### Step 1: Represent the Lines in Parametric Form
Given two lines in parametric form:

- **Line 1**: $\frac{x - x_1}{l_1} = \frac{y - y_1}{m_1} = \frac{z - z_1}{n_1}$
- **Line 2**: $\frac{x - x_2}{l_2} = \frac{y - y_2}{m_2} = \frac{z - z_2}{n_2}$

Where $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$ are points on the respective lines, and $(l_1, m_1, n_1)$ and $(l_2, m_2, n_2)$ are the direction of cosine (components of the direction vectors) of the lines.
#### Step 2: Set Up the System of Equations
Set up a system of equations based on the direction of cosine and the vector $\vec{d}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    l_1 \cdot l + m_1 \cdot m + n_1 \cdot n & = 0 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
    l_2 \cdot l + m_2 \cdot m + n_2 \cdot n & = 0 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\end{aligned}
$$
#### Step 3: Solve the System Using Cross Multiplication
Solve the above system using cross multiplication to find the values of $l$, $m$, and $n$
$$
\frac{l}{\text{Det}_1} = \frac{m}{\text{Det}_2} = \frac{n}{\text{Det}_3} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\text{Det}_1^2 + \text{Det}_2^2 + \text{Det}_3^2}}
$$
As, $\color{red}\sqrt{l^2+m^2+n^2}=1$

Where $\text{Det}_1$, $\text{Det}_2$, and $\text{Det}_3$ are determinants formed by the cross product of the direction of cosine and vector $\vec{d}$.
#### Step 4: Calculate the Shortest Distance
Use the formula to calculate the shortest distance $D$:
$$S.D = |l(x_2 - x_1) + m(y_2 - y_1) + n(z_2 - z_1)|$$
Substitute the values of $l$, $m$, and $n$ obtained from the cross multiplication step.
#### Step 5: Determine if the Lines are Coplanar
If the shortest distance $$S.D = 0$$<span style="background:#fff88f">the lines are coplanar.</span> 
If $$S.D \neq 0$$<span style="background:#b1ffff">the lines are not coplanar</span>, and the calculated value is the shortest distance between the two lines.
### Summary of Steps:
1. **Express** the lines in parametric form.
2. **Set up** and solve the system of linear equations using cross multiplication.
3. **Calculate** the shortest distance using the derived values.
4. **Check** for coplanarity based on the distance value.
